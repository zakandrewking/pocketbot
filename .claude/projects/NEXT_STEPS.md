# Next Steps

- [ ] Tune active/idle responsiveness further using the integration latency checks.
- [ ] Add `cmd/pb` integration coverage for home-screen status transitions.
- [x] Explore a non-line-consuming detach hint overlay (`Ctrl+D to detach`), ideally top-right; confirm tmux/Bubble Tea rendering limits.

- [ ] Validate top-right detach overlay behavior across common terminal apps and tmux versions.

# Done

- [x] Remove the home header `mode:` line.
